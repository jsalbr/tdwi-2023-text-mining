The car gave me a transmission light, after a few days of sluggish gear changes (namely, the car wanted to upshift, but first shot the RPMs up and only then changed into gear, alongside what felt like harsh shifting?), I went to a shop which sorted other issues on it, and here comes the biggest mistake. The error showed something along the lines of \u00ab 3-4 gear ratio monitoring \u00bb and the dude there reset my adaptation values, then did not properly advise me on the procedure that has to be followed after a reset, he just told me to go on the road and go through all gears with it, but did not tell me the further intricacies. Now, the RPM needle wobbles when doing an upshift, feeling a bit like it slips before it goes into gear. Same things happens if I let my foot off the gas and then press it again, car shoots up RPMs before settling and going. Once the car is in gear, it goes fine, no apparent issues, also read up that symptoms of a bad TC are RPM wobble on cruise control at around 80-100kmh, which my car does not exhibit. I've looked on the internet, and I have been able to pinpoint that the issue may be a bad seal in the transmission. The video also mentioned that a symptom of a bad such seal, adapter seal block, is increased pressures in the clutches. In the link below are the adaptation values pre and post reset.

At the time BimmerTech was offering a full system upgrade but the price tag was just too high and the entire deal just seemed to invasive so I put the idea on the shelf for quite a while. Then, a couple of months ago, I happened to dust off the idea and found their MMI Plus offering. It appeared to be plug-and-play, an easy DIY installation, pretty non-invasive and reasonably priced. After a bit of mulling, I pulled the trigger on it and trim removal tools on Monday and received it a day early, yesterday. It took the better part of three hours to install as I was taking my time and my head unit is the larger one that takes up all of the space you'd use for the \"easy install\". Thanks to that, I not only had to remove the three simple pieces of trim and the display but also the entire glove compartment to access the alternative space for the install. Everything worked perfectly the first time and it honestly sent a chill down my spine to see something new on my display after having owned the car for six years. The integration with the iDrive system is very tight and setup was simple. I am very impressed by the system and feel it was worth every penny to ditch my magnetic mount I use for my phone when I'm driving around the city (Google Maps is FAR superior to BMW's nav).

So I've been into bmws forever and have owned a few older ones but have never done a project with one. I started flirting with the idea of a turbo build and ever since I've been digging through tons of forum posts, and I need help deciding on some options. What seems to be the easiest to obtain and build with, at least according to forums, is an e36 with either an M50B25 or an M52B28. However I have two problems with this option. 1) I'm actually having a really hard time finding e36s online. I've been looking at FB marketplace and autotempest and options seem fairly limited to dilapidated and\/or already highly modded ones. M3s get mentioned a lot here, since they have engines already built for higher power, but frankly these are already in almost collectible territory, and WAY more expensive than just getting a much more common 325i or 328i and changing the camshafts, mani, injectors, etc. Another option would be an e46 with a M52B28TU or M54B30, but I'd need some opinions here as these seem a lot less common with tuners, and are also aluminum blocks as opposed to the iron blocks of the e36 engines mentioned (one thing I'm wondering is if the M52B28TUs in America are iron blocks I've read that that's true on some forums but I can't really find a consensus on that). However, the benefit here is that they seem a lot easier to find on FB marketplace and other auto websites than e36s surprisingly. Also, the e46 is my favorite bmw, and I even owned a 2002 330i until about 7 years ago (can you tell I wish I still had it?) Other options could be either an e34 with the same engine choices as the e36 or an e39 with the same engine choices as the e46. It mostly just depends on availability, for which it seems like e34s are really hard to find whereas e39s are really easy to find. Thank you very much to anyone who can help! TL;DR I want a pre 2005 project bmw to turbo and can't decide which one because e36s are way harder to find than I was hoping (maybe help me know where I should look for them)","len":391},{"id":"lxzqqv","subreddit":"BMW","text":"BMW x2 2019 s drive 28I brakes help.: So I am trying to take off the rear tires of my bmw so I can get to the rear brakes.

I bought my 2015 328i xDrive from Towne BMW in Buffalo, NY. When I got it in 2018 I was the second owner and the car seemed perfect and i didn't notice any rust on it or even any spots that could become problems. Now in Buffalo, we have a lot of snow and with that comes lots of salt on the roads which tends to be a problem for vehicles, including mine. Toward the tail end of 2020 I noticed rust on the passenger side of my vehicle on the bottom of both doors. At first I was pretty bummed out about it and figured i'd just use some touch up paint and sandpaper to do the best i could. I started looking online and found out about the 12 year unlimited mile corrosion warranty and all the posts about it seemed pretty dim with people saying that they were denied by multiple service centers and were told they needed annual rust inspections, even though most places don't offer them and the warranty doesn't mention it. I figured i'd bring it into my BMW dealer and the manager inspected it and sent it out to BMW corporate to review for approval on the warranty. After nearly a month i didn't hear anything and called back and was told that corporate had gone through some hiring and replacing people and my claim was lost in the process. Nearly one month later I was told corporate had wanted me to get an estimate. While getting the estimate I was told that they could just fix the rust but there was no guarantee it wouldn't come back due to where the rust was. They recommended to replace both doors instead of doing just fixing the rust. The cost was estimated around $5,000. My estimate was sent to BMW and they said i'd hear back later. After another month i ended up calling and they said that corporate needed to inspect my car and a person from there would come in a couple weeks. A couple weeks later I brought my car in for another inspection but this time by corporate. My warranty claim was approved and all I needed to do was schedule it. I brought my car in for the repair and it took 5 days to get it back. Although the process took longer than it should have i'm extremely happy that they honored the warranty.

I bought a 2014 328i last year with 20-30k on the odometer. Manual transmission. I bought it from my neighbor, who is a trusted friend, and also the second owner of the car. He had bought it from an elderly man who had bought it brand new but let it sit for over a year since he couldn't drive. My neighbor barely drove the car before reselling to me (it was for his wife and she didn't end up liking the stick). Anyway, I bought the car and it drives great and I love it. The only issue is that the car oil pressure warning has come on about 6 times. This has ONLY happened when I've been driving on the highway from my house in the flat city to the mountains, which is about a three hour trip. And the oil pressure sensor turns on at almost the same point in the drive every time when I am climbing up a large and gradual 6-7% incline hill. It almost always comes on as soon as I'm reaching the top of a hill (but am still on the incline). Each time, I pull over, turn the car off, check the oil level and no problems there. Then the car will be fine for a while. I took it to my mechanic and he did an oil analysis and found no debris in the oil or pump. He replaced the oil sensor just to see if that was causing the problem. And then he replaced the oil. He says he can see no obvious damage to or problems with the engine. I drove it to the mountains again after taking it to the shop and the warning turned on again. Same point in the drive going up a mountain incline at 60-70 mph in 4th or 5th gear a large hill but nothing ridiculous or overly steep. Any guesses as to what the problem could be?

Appreciate the help!: I like many others, am looking to buy a vehicle at possibly one of the worst times. I've posted a couple times in the whatcarshouldibuy sub, some of you may know they do not like Germans over there, though maybe they have some valid criticisms. I guess I'd rather go straight to the source of a vehicle I'm looking at so it led me here. I was originally looking at GTIs as I owned a Golf and loved I but wanted more umph. I ended up looking at ones 1000s of miles away which started to push the price of ones I was looking at over $30k (I'd realisticallylike to stay under $25k and I'm trying to stay on budget even if I see something I like). I've looked at audis and the Japanese luxuries as well. On the whatcarishouldbuysub they like to default to get a Honda or Mazda but if I'm being honest I'm just not into those cars. I still think the Euros have it down and how many civics do you see on the road? Que me continuing to look and I'll say I'm not adverse to coupes I owned an RSX and loved the damn thing. Thus I landed on the 2 series. I've done cost comparisons between the 2 and 3 series and some sites say the 2 wins out other says the 3 wins out. So I guess my question to you guys would be what do you think? Which would be cheaper to own. What engines are best for cost and reliability? I've seen some people say stay away from the 228. And do you have any links or sites that lay out what maintenence requirements year to year on these things will be or cost? That's the only draw to the Japanese manufacturers for me is that their maintenance requirements\/costs seem to be lower. Here is a 2 series I was looking into: _URL_ Red flags that popped out to me are the 30000 miles and only 2 maintenence records. I also just got off the phone with the dealer and he told me that the dealer isn't required to put their service on the carfax so it's fine and been maintained. He also then informed me they don't do out of state sales so I guess the deals dead anyway.

A much better kept secret is that it's also one of the most reliable cars ever made. This may come as a surprise to many because there is no shortage of fake news to found online claiming that the E46 is ridden with problems. It's easy to see why some people fall for this considering the early 2000s were plagued with unreliable sports cars like the Honda S2000, Mazda MX-5 Miata, and C5 corvette. The false claims of unreliability are scattered and poorly thought out. They range from excessive rod bearings wear, VANOS camshaft hubs breaking off, and SMG pump failures to subframe cracks, leaking gaskets, and electrical gremlins. It is clear that these claims were invented by the media to artificially lower the price of the E46 M3 so that car journalist can slowly buy up these cars up until they control the supply. At which point they will denounce their previous claims and demand prices in the 6-figure range for their cars. This type of market manipulation is not new. Why do you think classic muscle cars and air-cooled Porsches shot up in value? Do your own research. If you don't believe me, then look online. There is literally no proof of any of these so-called common problems ever happening. **2.** **The Singular of Data is Anecdote** My friend Richard leased a 2017 320i before he got his Model 3 and had almost no problems throughout his whole ownership. In contrast to this, I've heard countless stories online about how unreliable Audi's 2.7t engines are. Not only that, have you seen the pictures of the V8 S4 timing chains? Yikes Audi, I'll pass. Once you take Audi out of the equation, that leaves only BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, Tesla, and Porsche. Any self-respecting man knows that Lexus and Mercedes are for women so now we're left with just BMW, Tesla, and Porsche. I, and most other people, can't afford the payments on a Porsche and I don't believe in global warming, so this means that BMWs are literally the only drivable cars left. **3.** **Why Would People Buy New BMWs if They're Ugly and Unreliable?** This one's just common sense. I didn't get my 2 Series Gran Coupe because it's a particularly pretty car. I bought it because of its excellent RWD driving dynamics, sweet I6 sounds, and of course its unparaded reliability.

We've been a one-car family for quite some time. I work from home, but coming this summer will need one occasionally AND because I want a car. just because. this isn't r\/personalfinance, don't need to hear advice to invest the money and buy a Corolla. Was hoping for something fun, but with four doors....in the past I've done some autox and was hoping to get back into that, too. After much research I decided a preowned MK7 GTI DSG was right for me (preferable an SE or Autobahn). Have a knee that got achy with my last stick shift, so I'd like to move on from that. Unfortunately, the used car market has been pretty aggressive this year, and so far I haven't been able to get into a GTI with my preferred specs within my budget (after upping the budget several times). While looking, I've noticed some 328i's popping up in great condition, 30-40k miles, for less than what I was planning to spend on the GTI. I have a good amount of experience behind the wheel of an F30, with my good friend owning one over the last few years. Now, I'm perfectly aware BMW's take a little more tlc than the Japanese cars I've been used to. I dove into this knowing well the GTI would require more maintenance and likely have more expensive repairs. My question would be, is the 328i comparable in terms of overall cost to own? After doing some research on repairpal, etc, I'm seeing pretty similar results between the two vehicles. Would, say, a 2016 328i with 40k miles out of warranty be a terrible move?

We bought it at high mileage, 220k kilometers to be exact, it was obvious some things would have to be changed. Whatever, it was cheap enough. One week owning it, not having driven it yet, we pull the engine and do some maintenance. A new timing chain kit, upgrade clutch from a 120d... And some basic maintenance. I buy myself some sweet tools, after all I have a BMW now, I give the car a stage 1 tune. It goes like a dart, the torque on these is sick! I mean the car has no options, just AC which probably came standard, but it's been awesome to play with so far. Though I noticed something, why does BMW have set intervals for maintenance, such as brakes that are basically a mileage counter that counts down and that's when you should check it. According to BMW anyway. But that's something minor. There's a bigger problem here, the dreaded Diesel Particulate Filter. The software doesn't lie, BMW sets this to 250.000KM before it apparently \"dies\". It throws a code (452A) that says it's nearing it's end-of-life. Not only that, but somehow they \"calculate\" the amount of soot in the DPF and how many oil ash. The car suddenly starts doing regens really frequently to a point that your fuel consumption averages sometimes 2 liters more than normal. This is all based on the mileage counter on the damn thing. Because it throws that error it doesn't even do the regen correctly, then you lose power because the DPF is full. What this software basically does is clog the DPF once it nears it's \"end of life\". So I can't grasp *why*. The materials in one allow for far more distance than just 250k, especially if you only really have motorway kilometers. Whatever, I was monitoring the turbo pressure and when that error came up the thing didn't really make much boost at all (1.3 bar peak) so I had back pressure. After doing a service reset and dumping DPF cleaner in the tank it took a 30km drive on the highway cruising in 6th gear and a DPF Regen request using bimmerlink. EGT stayed at 630C all the way unlike before where it would ramp to 600 then cool off again, when I got off the highway I checked the boost pressure and sure as hell it did 1.5 bar like nothing (which is what's in the stock map, btw). Just why, why does BMW complicate things, I have yet to see a diesel that doesn't have DPF problems. BMW makes the car kill itself after 250k, if it hasn't died yet at 30 because of the timing chain.","len":475},{"id":"l1ksq5","subreddit":"BMW","text":"E46 transmission oil cooling line blew up.

The current engine is rather tired, repairing it costs more than replacing it with a similar working motor. Doing an Engine Swap here isn't as easy as it would be in the US due to strict rules. People do it but it's a risky process that would end up my car confiscated if ever caught. Transmission: Ideally I want a manual swap, but I can't find any kinds of conversion kits online.

That money was initially a backup for college fee in case i couldn't make it). I've always dreamed about driving any sports car and this seems like a great opportunity too. But then again, i did a lot of research before giving up to my emotions and hence needed some advise. 1. I'm just 19 and have no first hand driving experience whatsoever. I've sat in many sportscars before and tbh i was a bit over cautious and alert despite just being a passenger lol. I've gotten over the phase where i had a temptation to impress people, but still i don't feel qualified enough to drive a car like M340i (read a lot of posts about M3 here, but hardly any about the 340i). It's fast and i may eventually feel the urge to drive fast at times fs (not really willing to take any risks or pulling off stunts still). 2. The car costs $109K (after taxes) in our country. And it's the cheapest performance oriented car available here ( Focus, Golf and the rest of those cars aren't sold here ) . All of the expenses are gonna go straight to my dad, and maintaining BMWs are no joke. So i was thinking whether i should even think of this car despite it coming under our budget (a little tight still). 3. I'd take it out like 4-6 times per month for some short distance travel, so fuel won't be much of an issue. Roads here are good, but there are some spots filled with potholes and speed bump, with a low ground clearance , that's another concern.Plus we won't be selling this car soon though.

So when I put the car into sport plus, the JB4 gets enabled. So far my best idea is to insert an embedded system (i.e. raspberry Pi, something custom) somewhere into the car (i.e. obd2 port) and have that listen for the CAN codes indicating the engine mode has been switched. Then I will have to switch the JB4 tune using the steering wheel buttons to and try and figure out what CAN packets are sent when switching JB4 tunes.

I was also looking at mk4 jettas, and the GLIs can look really sporty for a normally economy car, and although I do like the Jettas, the BMWs really catch my eye, and in a perfect world, would be my first car.

However, I'm not familair with the \"do it yourselfability\" of fixing a BMW, and since it's German and luxury, I would expect a few aspects would be a pain to fix yourself. So to you guys that bought a high mileage bmw: how much maintenance did you have to deal with, and were you able to do it yourself? My budget is at most 5-6k, so if buying a high mileage beamer means that I just have to sway out some old parts(like a tie rod, or timing belt), then the market for cars that I can buy would expand a lot! WHich is also another thing, BMWs are more expensive, so if i mess the car breaks, I'd be losing a lot more money than if I were to get a Jetta. But also, are parts expensive for a BMW from 1990-2004? Another thing is that BMW is a luxury brand, and I don't like BMW for the luxury but for the style and performance, and some beamers are sporty, where others are luxury. A Jetta, however, is economy, but I can make it sporty, so that's another thing I'm considering. So do you guys think I'm better off with a Jetta and specing it out, or sending it with a Beamer?

If you don't want to read the whole thing than the next paragraph or two might be enough to form an opinion on. I currently have an F30 328i but recently I've been looking to \"downgrade\" to an E46 330 ZHP. I have downgrade in quotes because from everything I have seen, the E46 ZHP is a special car. The F30 is a good car and the technology\/features are great, but I can easily make do without them. My main gripe is that the driving experience is a little...uninspiring. I have the adaptive m suspension and the car handles amazingly but even with the 6 speed manual I feel almost no connection to the car. I don't care too much about performance specs, I mostly care about the actual driving experience. Even now the F30 is plenty fast for me, although from the looks of it I wouldn't be losing much performance with the ZHP, at least on paper. I'm currently in college and commuting so I would be using the car pretty much everyday, and from everything I have seen, the ZHP is very good at being a good daily as well as being a fun car. Anyways, my dad thinks my idea is stupid. He thinks I should keep the F30 and sell it once I graduate and get something else. He and I also have different viewpoints on cars, he would rather have luxury and features than hydraulic steering or a good engine note, whereas I'm the opposite. Seeing as he is my dad though, there is a good possibility that he is right. I think that I could sell the F30 and get into a nice, reasonable mileage ZHP and have money left over for maintenance\/repairs, many of which I am capable of doing myself. Another thing I have considered is depreciation, it's likely that by the time I finish college the F30 will lose around $3-4k in depreciation due to age and my mileage average. ZHPs on the other hand have remained relatively stable in value or even gone up recently but with mileage obviously it would still depreciate, albeit at a lower rate than the F30. I would rather spend $2-3k on maintenance for a car I really enjoy than lose the same money to depreciation on a car that I didn't enjoy as much. Anyways, does anyone have any opinions on my thought process? I realize the two cars are pretty different and I am planning to test drive a ZHP before listing the F30. At the end of the day the F30 is a good car and I am incredibly fortunate to have it, so I have no problem keeping it for the foreseeable future, but if there is something I would enjoy more and it wouldn't be a significant cost difference, then why not?","len":496},{"id":"mr2uo2","subreddit":"BMW","text":"The infuriating thing about looking for BMWs to buy: Is that so many SMG owners will list their car under \"manual\".

Around 48 k miles, my subwoofer blew. It developed this horrible flatulent sound that is very obvious even with talk radio. Pretty much any frequency that activates the subwoofer would cause a very loud rattling noise. It's not a mechanical sound, it is definitely coming from the under-seat sub. There isn't anything rattling around. I took it to a dealer initially before I knew what it was. At that time the issue was intermittent and hard to replicate reliably, so the first dealer thought it was the door lock and they placed some damping material in there. The problem quickly came back, and a second dealer correctly diagnosed it as the subwoofer gone bad. At that point I was right around 49 k miles and they replaced the subwoofer under warranty. That fixed the issue... for a while. Here's what it sounds like: _URL_ Now it's been about 3 weeks and the problem has recurred again! The subwoofer clearly sounds blown again. It's super loud and obnoxious. It's also very apparent when accelerating both in sport and comfort modes, thanks to Active Sound, so it's bothersome even with the stereo off. The weird thing is, I almost NEVER listen to loud music. I certainly don't drive around with my car shaking from loud bass. I mostly just listen to podcasts and NPR. I have a hard time understanding how I could blow the sub again so quickly. One hypothesis I have is maybe Active Sound is somehow killing my sub? I did drive with sport mode yesterday, and noticed the problem had recurred today. With sport mode in the higher RPM's, the car does get loud, and some of the noise is from the MPPK exhaust but I think some is augmented by the stereo. I'm not out of warranty, but will bring it back to the dealer next week and see if maybe they'd be willing to fix it free of charge since the problem occurred while the warranty was active and the first repair didn't work.

The front bumper was changed but was never painted with the rest of the car. The car was rear ended as well, but no significant and only a few cracks. Didn't look serious at all. Several dings all over the bumper too. The door's actuator (left) went out which you have to open it manually, however he's providing tools to fix the problem.

With that in mind, I'd love to get the thinking from other BMW owners who may have been in the same decision making steps. Context: Car is only vehicle that we own (for the moment) it's a 2016 X5d and we've done considerable amount of package upgrades (3rd row seating just in case), rear entertainment system, luxury trim. The car was used for NYC area driving and since COVID it's been used for travel back and forth from NYC to rural Connecticut (second residence in ski country). So we've gone from urban short distance driving with the occasional family road trip to more rural longer distance driving and then going between residences. Luckily no problems with the car other than roof drain that was kinked during manufacture and subsequently blocked and wet roof (repaired under warranty). Offer: So I have an offer from our dealership that looks like it's done via a 3rd party carrier (American Guardian Warranty Services) for the Platinum Package that goes to 100,000mi or 72 months for $6,939.69. Exclusions: This package covers everything and specifically excludes routine maintenance items such as oil, coolant, fluids, refrigerant, battery, tires, brake pads, brake drums, brake shoes, brake rotors, exhaust system, shock absorbers, interior trim, exterior appearance (this is a lot of exclusions!). Inclusions: It seems like the inclusions are electrical components, engine parts, gaskets, axel, suspension components, a\/c components, technology components I've seen some eye-watering invoices in this subreddit but I am looking at the most likely repairs to the car (brakes, tires) and those seem like they're outside this offer (yes I realize tires aren't covered...but I do have a tire and rim repair policy that's paid for itself thank you NYC).

I thought I'd come here for help since you guys are very knowledgeable on, and have a passion for these cars. A little background, I've always wanted to own a BMW, since even before I was old enough to drive. I've never know anyone who owned one growing up, I just liked the way they looked and they seemed really comfortable. I got the family beater as a hand-me-down (99 Subaru legacy) and drove that until I graduated highschool, and then bought an old Toyota Tacoma when I moved out. I recently moved for my job and ended up selling my truck so now I'm looking to purchase a new daily driver. I've been saving\/investing my money these past few years and looking at cars to upgrade to (the Tacoma was a great daily and very useful, just not \"fun\") and I finally feel like I'm at a point in life where I can get my dream car. As I stated before, I'm looking for a new daily driver, and since I live in a big city in the Midwest, I'm looking for something with all wheel drive, preferably 4 doors, and is an automatic. Since this will be my only car (besides a project car I recently picked up) I'm looking for something that is very reliable. I was spoiled with my Subaru and Tacoma, they were insanely reliable so that is a big thing for me. I understand maintenance costs can be expensive with these cars, but I am starting to learn how to work on cars myself and I always have money set aside for emergencies so that isn't a huge worry for me. Although this will be my daily, I'm still looking for something fun, I really want a car that can do everything from getting groceries and driving friends around, to going to car meets or even hitting up the track. I'd like something with about 250-300+ hp and I love cars that can snap, crackle, pop. From what I've been looking at so far, I really like the old (1988-1996) 5 series, the M235\/M240, and the 440i, although I'm not sure if the old 5 series would be a good daily. I'm looking for something on the newer side (2011 or newer, minus the old 5 series) and my budget is $25k-$30k on the top end, although I'd go up to $35k at the absolute highest. I hate to keep bringing it up, but reliability is one of the biggest deciding factors for me and I've heard mixed things about BMW reliability, I'd still be willing to sacrifice a little for a BMW though.

It's a 2021 330i. My car is being serviced at the dealer and is costing me about $2000 to be repaired. Well on my way home from the dealership (while driving their loaner car) a huge rock popped up from the road and shattered the front window. It's bad enough that it will need to be replaced. So the dealer is saying I need to pay to have it repaired, and saying if I don't they'll hit my insurance. They're also trying to charge me retail pricing to do so which is almost $1100. I can have the window changed for $850 (using a window bought directly from a bmw dealer at a retail cost of $730 including tax) and a local guy who has changed other BMW windows as well (including a new X7) so I know he does good work.

I paid $275 on ebay for the Maxpeedingrods e36 adjustable coilovers. My car has a front end from an e36 and rear from an e30 (or so I have been told) so fitment was a bit weird in the back. I ended up running the springs without the adjustable collars so that they had more play when I lowered the car. Originally, I had the springs on the threaded metal perches, and at my ride height the stiffness in the rear was unbearable. The spring was basically fully compressed at my ride height. After removing the metal collars and placing the springs on the stock rubber discs, the spring has just enough compression to ride low and much more smoothly. I dropped the car about 1.5 inches (best guess) and it looks really good. Rides rougher than stock (expected) but corners much better and eliminated a lot of body roll. For someone who has never driven a car with \"good\" coilovers, I have no complaints and I am very pleased. I have only had them on for a few days, so I cannot speak on their longevity. The front coils pop a bit at low speeds when turning hard, but I bought some spray on lubricant (i think its silicone) that has nearly eliminated the issue.

Knowing my car most likely won't make it, and the tires are bad, I made a very very stupid mistake (please don't judge, won't ever do it again!) I literally floored the gas pedal all the way going up the hill. Without ever stepping off the entire time. So when I almost made it up the hill, the car suddenly went into the redline zone, and a loud beeping noise came on, and then a ton of lights came on the dashboard. (ABS light, tire pressure light, steering system light, airbag light, red brake light) I install smelled a heavy burning odor, and the car engine was louder than it ever had been. So I freaked out, and immediately stepped on the brake, and then eventually turning off the engine. I sat there for a few minutes, and then started the car again, most of the lights were still on. And after about 30 minutes of getting help from a nice group of people, I was able to finally get the car up on the hill (I never floored it this time! I just gently stepped on the gas) After I parked my car I opened the hood and there was a light smoke coming off, but I didn't notice anything visibly damaged. But I did notice that every time I give it a little gas, the car gets extremely hot.

The only LEDs in the car now are in the turn indicators on the side view mirrors and I like LEDs because they are instant-on, cleaner looking, much brighter, and longer lasting. I plan to leave the headlights as is. I found these bulbs, but I also see resistors and relays recommended alongside the LEDs. It says that if LED bulbs are used without an inline resistor, the load is insufficient and the car will think the bulbs are burnt out, resulting in fast blinking and a possible warning indicator. AFAIK the '04 Beetle is not a CAN-BUS car; that came later in the A5\/PQ35 platform cars. Do they make 12V bulbs now that have proper resistance that work as a drop-in replacement? If not, what parts will I need to properly convert the incandescents to LEDs? What I mean by 'dim' mode is the fact that traditional tail lamps have dual filaments to support dim and bright operation (headlights on, and brake pedal switch). LED bulbs shouldn't require two separate elements; rather, just a bit of circuitry to dim the LED in response to the voltage input on one of the legs of the bulb socket.","len":248},{"id":"lmivuy","subreddit":"Volkswagen","text":"Replace clutch lines 08 Golf Mk5 R32: Hey All, Vehicle is a 2008 Golf Mk5 R32 190 000km based in Australia.

I have a code P05A0 that is giving me a CEL. I believe has something to do with the active grille shutters being obstructed or blocked. I've thoroughly checked them for any debris or dirt, and nothing. After some googling I came across a technical service bulletin by VW regarding replacing the AGS motor number and provide an example of which motors need to be replaced. I just so happen to have the exact part number that is pictured (95B-965-501-D). Ok..... Getting somewhere service bulletin stated they replaced the motor with a new one part number 95B-965-501-H. Only problem is that part number just doesn't exist anymore on any parts site or vw\/audi dealership in town. I've come across part number 95B-965-501-AA VW's site description of this item says it replaces 95B-965-501-H but does not list my year as compatible. Decide to try it out. Dealership has it in stock, take bumper off, disassemble the ags and replace it with the new 95B-965-501-AA motor.

Looking for some insight on scirocco with really weird exterior lights electrical issues: I'm having some weird electrical issues, I'll start the story from the beginning... So basically I have a 2011 Scirocco, and during last winter everything was essentially snowed in for so long I could run the car for well over a month, and as a result, battery died. So I took the battery out, charged it with a wall charger, car went back to working fine again, however the battery kept losing voltage when standing in the parking lot very quickly after that, usually if it would sit still for about a week it would already get issues starting again, besides that it had no other issues though, but the pandemic had all the garages nearby here closed down.. Fast forward to yesterday, after I started the car (had no issues starting whatsoever), the check light on the dash came on, turned out the right front indicator wasn't working, anyway I had no choice to drive that day so I did anyway (I know...), since I at least still had the mirror indicator working. After having arrived at the destination and starting the car again to drive back home, the front right headlight stopped working, as did the left rear indicator, and the front right citylight, being in the middle of nowhere I had no choice but to still drive back home so I did (again, I know...) \u200b I checked all the fuses in the fusebox, but they're all fine Now, I have taken out all of the lightbulbs individually and tested them on a bench powersupply, they all work fine, so I took both front indicators out to see if the right headlight would turn on, (since that's where the issue started), but to no avail So I reseated all the cables, nothing, then I took the headlights out, but the rear left blinker still didn't work, put everything back in, took the left rearlight out, front blinker and right headlight still didn't work Now I measured all the cables with a multimeter, and when I turn on the light there is no power going to the cables of the lights that aren't working. For example the left headlight is getting power just fine, the right headlight does not The battery however has a voltage of 11.78v, could this be wreaking the havoc? I find it difficult to believe since the car starts fine, also everything else works, the headunit, the interior lights, the airconditioning, the windshield wipers, the seat heaters, everything, it only seems to affect the exterior lights I am completely stumped at this point, literally nothing happened between the one day that I parked it and everything was fine, and the next day the blinker stopped working..

I feel like the smoke is a combination of oil and coolant as it produces a huge whitish cloud. I took it to a well reviewed shop in town and we agreed on swapping the turbo, since it looked old and was likely the cause of the problem. So we put in a K04 and he said they did essentially a \"Stage 1+\" software tune. It drove better, with more power. But after a few days it did it again. So the turbo didn't really help.

The one I'm looking at is $26k and has 65k miles on it. The dealer called me today and I'm planning on going in to discuss price. The vehicle has a clean Carfax report and the dealership is reputable, but as I've never owned a VW before, I'm a bit hesitant about the mileage and price. The dealership includes a 30 day powertrain warranty, but I'd still like some more reassurance. This is the Carfax report. Looks like the most recent owner did regular oil\/filter changes and a fluids check. Unfortunately, there's no record of DSG Trans service or Haldex oil change. The car was also sold at auction. Is this any cause for concern? _URL_ I'm planning on bringing this up to the dealer to factor into a lower price than what they're asking since I'll need to get service done. I'm looking to get the following serviced if I chose to buy it: -Cabin filter replacement -DSG trans fluid service * -Haldex oil change * -Serpentine belt replacement -Spark plugs -Engine air filter -Oil\/filter change -Brake check -Tire rotation -Pre-purchase inspection * -Water pump inspection\/potential replacement Based on what I've seen online, it's looking like all this will cost me in the ballpark of $1500-$2000. Do these seem like reasonable repairs based on the car's history and does this seem like a decent cost estimate? TLDR: 1) Is a Golf R being sold at auction a red flag? 2) Should I avoid this since no major maintenance was done besides basic fluid, oil, and brake checks? 3) Does this service and price seem reasonable?

I am an owner of a 2013 Jetta TDI Sportwagen that currently has \\~64k miles on it. I purchased it with \\~56k miles two years ago. It was one of the emissions scandal vehicles and was repaired by VW. I've put less than 10k miles on it in two years and I'm the second owner. The vehicle cost about 10k used and still had the base warranty plus the emissions warranty, which I thought was a great deal. About 6 months into owning this vehicle, a transmission problem emerged. When accelerating, RPMs jump, but there is no power. At first, this happened very rarely, but became more often and consistent as time went on. This is happening at all speeds and at all times. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to when or why it occurs, but it is extremely jarring. The car almost shudders when the rpms jump and the power falls. When this occurs at speed it's a scary feeling. I was taking it to a local import shop for basic maintenance and they were shocked at this saying: it's extremely rare for this transmission to fail. I eventually switched to a local dealership, and after diagnosis wanted to put a new speed sensor in. I reluctantly did this to a tune of $1,200. This did not fix the problem. After a subsequent diagnosis they want to put in a new mechatronic unit, but \"could not confirm this would fix the problem\". This was going to cost $2800 usd. I attempted to get this covered under warranty. I have a record of this occurring while still under warranty (prior to 60k miles), but was denied because the dealership \"could not recreate the issue\". They claim they will revisit the issue if the dealer mechanic can recreate the problem. So, now I'm stuck with a car with a bad transmission and a repair that might cost 50% of the working value. I would like to continue to push on VW to warranty this, but I'm not sure how to proceed. My options include: taking it back to the same dealership and asking for another evaluation (this may cost money), talking to another dealership (will also cost me), cut bait and run (losing most value), other...? The problem is happening so frequently that I'm shocked the dealership cannot recreate the issue, and it makes me question their motives. If i can get them to drive it more (take it home?) they would certainly experience the problem. My import shop guy tells me VW will warranty most problems without an issue, so I'm at a loss. Can I get VW to fix this for me?

I drove my Golf a forty-minute drive home (mainly highway, and yes, I drove it home, but it was sketchy as all hell). Temperature gauge sat between 1800F- 1900F the whole way home. I let it sit running in my driveway for a few minutes, and the fans kicked on; temperature gauge sitting around 2150F. I kicked the heater on, and the temperature dropped to around 2000F. The previous owner said the water pump was replaced a year ago, as well as the coolant. My question here is, because I'm having a hard time finding an accurate measurement, what is the idle\/ optimal temperature for these older Golfs? Is it as high as 2150F, or do I have a sticky thermostat? I planned on replacing the thermostat, since the previous owner didn't say if it was replaced or not, but I'm more curious if that is an issue, or if running at that temperature at idle after driving is normal (overheating light did NOT turn on when the fans kicked on).","len":197},{"id":"mujia2","subreddit":"Volkswagen","text":"Front Assist Issue Jetta R-Line 2019, Warranty Question: Does having your car repaired void my VW warranty? I cant seem to find a definite answer online for my situation so I figure I post it myself. I have a 2019 Jetta R-Line 2019 and recently just got into a minor accident (pictures). I basically veered off my right and plowed through fencing to avoid a rear end accident. Most damage is on the right side: front and rear bumper replaced, rocker panel and rear right door. Before I brought it to the mechanic shop, I checked all sensors and they were all working normally. I just picked up the car couple days ago after the repair and as soon as I drove it off at highway speed, this \"Front Assist not Available\" warning message came on. I tried disabling it and enabling back on after few minutes and cleaning the VW emblem where the sensor is suppose to be (as suggested by other forum) but it still showing the warning. I checked the connector and it is connected and sitting properly. I read on other VW forums that shops mostly cant fix this problem since it most likely a software issue. Should I even bother bringing this back to the shop or should I bring it straight to VW repair shop to have it fix there? Is this issue still under VW warranty? Bonus Question: To owners here with front assist, do you guys find it helpful or do you guys turn it off? I asked because I feel it has something to do with my accident; I admit that I was perhaps driving pretty close but had it not for the front assist buckling up my breaks (which made me skid and lose control a bit making me veer off all the way to my right), I thought I couldve save the rear end with me just normally breaking.","len":320},{"id":"kvh63r","subreddit":"Volkswagen","text":"Haaaaaalp: Howdy!

I test drove a 2018 VW Tiguan SEL 2.0 4motion today and absolutely fell in love with the driving experience. The openness and visibility fit my needs and I was more impressed with the VW than the Rav4 4runner I was recommended to look into. I know Toyota has a cult following for being extremely reliable but they just felt enclosed when driving. A lot of the forums I've seen \"VW is awful\" or \"German engineering is a God\" sort of perspective. In the past I've driven an 05 Subaru Forester, which I loved until the heads started going ( bought used at a ridiculous low price so I knew that was probably going to happen eventually) and an 05 VW Beetle that was a total lemon and I had nothing but problems but when she ran I took her on lots of adventures. I'm not necessarily concerned at all about regular maintenance as I do like to keep my vehicles maintained healthy. But am hesitant heading back into VW with the issues I ran into. Granted the vehicle I purchased is probably one of VW worst. Again, it's about the visibility for me. I'm a small human under 5 foot and like to sit up higher on the road if a truck was in my price point right now I would be heading in that direction. However, I do need to fit a car seat, 60 lb dog gear as I often drive, camp and escape to hot springs often. Not much off roading but plenty of dirt roads I want to be comfortable driving on. I don't drive a ton daily less than 3 miles to work so I would be putting miles on the vehicle pretty slowly. Anyways, I'm looking into a couple Tiguans SEL both priced under $25k one with 9k miles the other with 30k about $5,000 cheaper price point. I want to own this vehicle for the next 5-6 years possibly longer. They both would have the remaining warranty as they only had 1 previous own can be transferred. What's the longevity of the Tiguan? Small repairs and maintenance I'm not concerned about but replacing a transmission at 60k or engine around 100k I am. They're attractive rigs I truly want to be happy with my decision but don't want to kick myself in a few years after I'm only halfway off paying my loan off. Thank you so much!

My other vehicles of consideration are the Mazda 3 or 6, Toyota Camry, or a Ford Fusion. I've read through most if not all previous posts on Reddit and most of the internet questioning Volkswagens reliability. I figured I'd toss my hand in asking owners what they think about them. This car would mostly be utilized for college transportation, random road trips, and commuting to my job. The MPG figures and price on used 15+ Jettas really peak my interest, and I really dig the 19+ style, especially the GLI, granted the GLI has worse mpg figures, but may be worthwhile. I'm mainly curious if I really should be considering a Jetta, as this will be my 5-10 year car at minimum, I don't intend on replacing my next car after my lease is up for quite a long time, so naturally the go to option most people will say is, Camry. But I figured I would ask, if you VW owners would say a Jetta or golf would give me 5-10 years of hopefully reliable transportation, or if I should look elsewhere.

It's the 2.5 liter engine. Whenever I accelerate, there is a noise, not really a typical whining sound of a bad belt, but not really a squealing sound either. It is more like a sound of metal rubbing together, but it doesn't sound real grind-ey. It just sounds like a smooth rubbing sound, although it sounds like a problem. It gets loud once the motor reaches 2000 RPM and gets louder the higher the RPMs go. I put the car in neutral and revved it to see if I could narrow it down to motor or transmission, and it still made the noise in neutral. Based on what I have read from some quick internet searches is that it could be belt related or a bad pulley. The thing is I'm not sure what it could be based on the sound it is making. It doesn't sound like any normal belt squeaking. The noise is kind of hard to explain, and I apologize if I didn't do a good enough job of explaining it the best I can.

Pretty strong money for a '69. Matt did a great job but this car was built to be a driver, and is very solid but not a perfect show car.

GTI vs GLI. (Most likely 2019 models): Mainly this post is about the resale value and depreciation. From what I have seen and heard a GTI will hold value better than a GLI because it's just more iconic and better known, is this a correct assumption. Also which do you guys prefer and why? I'm curious to know your guys opinions. I think the GTI has sportier handling and since they both have the same power train and LSD it gives that edge to the GTI. The GLI probably has more room and maybe better fuel economy. Finally this is a VW question in general probably closer along the lines of these specific vehicles. Truthfully how long can these last? Assuming proper and average maintenance. I had bought a 2015 Golf S @ 59k miles and it began having engine issues within 10k miles of driving that I ended up having to give it up for.

I am looking for a new car, and I found two VW cars that I narrowed it down to, but I have no experience with these particular models or PHEVs in general, so if you can help me out, I would really appreciate it. Option 1 is a Golf GTE 2017\/10 (facelift) at 91.000 km (56k miles). Cons: no panoramic roof, fabric seats, no virtual cockpit. Option 2 is a Passat GTE sedan, 2015\/5, at 143.000 km (89k miles) which is pretty much loaded, virtual cockpit, DCC, Dynaudio, massage leather seats, pano roof, etc. My questions: What should I look out for when I inspect the cars? Any common issues? Battery degradation? How can I make sure it is still good? Is there any way to see total mileage on electricity alone? I would be charging the car at home from a 220v socket overnight. Apparently that will take about 4 hours for a full charge, is that correct? Should I only charge to 80% to keep the battery health as good as possible? Charging cable (or the battery itself) Cadmium recall? Would that affect either car? Can I check online or only at a VW dealer, if it was recalled and if the repairs were done? Rear seat headroom and legroom? How sloped is the Passat? Is it smaller than a Golf? Does either of these seem overpriced? Which will have the better resale value? Golf is 21.400 EUR, Passat is 20.400 EUR.

First post here and it's a long one; TLDR at the bottom. I'm looking into Mk6 Golf TDI's and 2011\/12 models seem to be in my price range in California (about $10k). I'm curious to hear from those who have owned cars from these years and whether or not it's the right car for me. Some background info: I'm looking for something reliable that will at least last me a good 5-10 years and won't break the bank to maintain. I am somewhat comfortable with a wrench and could likely perform basic maintenance and small repairs myself. This would be a daily driver, seeing a mix of city and highway with what could potentially be a 75+ mile round trip commute per day and a few longer trips per year (up and down the west coast). With some help from a few VW-owning friends, I've talked myself into a Golf TDI, as it seems to be a great mix of practicality, reliability, and personality (as solid as they may be, I don't particularly want to wind up in something like a Civic or Corolla). That brings me to the Mk6 and one that I've been monitoring online. Are there any reasons to search for a particular year of MK6 or will they all be fairly similar? I know sometimes certain components can vary between model years and I don't want to be left high and dry when it comes to maintenance and repair costs if I can circumvent that by buying a different year. I've been eyeing a 2011 with ~56k miles on it for $9,999. It seems to be in excellent condition, two owners with a clean Carfax report, emissions system has been updated and is still under warranty through July 2022 but it appears to have been on the lot for 70+ days. It seems like these typically move quickly so is that a red flag? I'm planning on making a rather long trip to check it out if it's there next week but don't want to waste my time.

If the confirmation comes that our vehicle will be produced without radar, I will cancel the order. There is no question from an engineering perspective that radar is superior to cameras in some very important aspects: it can quickly determine distance, it can penetrate materials to determine object positioning, and it is unaffected by light \/ dust \/ fog, and snow. A radar can detect a car stopping short ahead of the view-blocking truck in front of you. Cameras, on the other hand, are not great at doing any of the above. Radar has its own issues of course, but paired with cameras, the setup works well. There are numerous questions which remain unanswered that underline this concern: Why did they delete their own blog post describing in great depth exactly why radar is needed? How are they panning to address camera limitations (e.g. camera can't see beyond vehicle in front, it's affected by dirt, light etc.) There is no longer a secondary system now, after radar is removed. It's cameras only, where is the redundancy? Why is Tesla declining to comment on requests from all major news organizations? If they are confident enough about this, and it's not a cost cutting measure why is this not applied to all vehicles but only the cheaper 3\/Y? If it's not a cost cutting measure why aren't they passing on the savings of removing the hardware but actually increasing the cost of 3\/Y once again just a few days back? If they are confident in it, why isn't all what used to be standard functionality available on delivery but \"in the near future\" I think this is a very poor decision on behalf of Tesla, this is a cost cutting and\/or component shortage-driven decision and it makes me feel that I've been taken for a ride waiting for 2+ months for a vehicle that was essentially sold to me under false pretense. It's bullshit, and I won't stand for it.","len":405},{"id":"n70zcw","subreddit":"Tesla","text":"Is it possible to get whatsapp on tesla model 3: I bought the tesla model 3 a few days ago and i cant find out if there is whatsapp on here.

I thought I would share my experience to help others facing the same dilemma. My car recently passed 41,000 miles and my OEM Continental Tires were dropping to under 4mm of thread. Given that I live in Florida and we are coming into the rainy season where we get afternoon down pores that can make driving dangerous I thought it prudent to go ahead and get new tires. The proverbial problem is which tires? I read reviews and forum member recommendations and considered my needs: 1. Great wet weather performance, 2. great dry performance, 3. Quiet as possible, 4. good handling, 5. long wearing and 6. fuel efficiency. Notice that price was not on my list because any top brand was going to be more than the average price for tires given the cars weight and tire sizes. I narrowed down to 3 choices: 1. The safe choice was to replace with the original OEM tires, 2. Michelin CrossClimate 2, and 3. Continental Extreme Contact DWS 06 Plus. I selected the Michelin Cross Climate 2. Michelin gives you 60 days to try and be satisfied and it received a lot of good reviews. While I haven't had them long enough to tell you how well they met my criteria in all respects what I can tell you is what I have observed so far. Much to my surprise given their aggressive tread pattern, they are really quiet compared to the OEM tires. Even rough surfaces are significantly quieter. This was a very pleasant surprise. Handling is also superior to the OEM tires. Steering weight and turn in on curves is easy, smooth and fun! The OEM tires always felt heavy and difficult to turn and on turns I always felt like the car didn't want to follow the road but just go straight ahead. Wow! What a difference. I can tell the grip feels superior on dry pavement but I haven't had rain yet to test it in the rain. I also don't have enough miles to compare efficiency so I don't know what penalty I will get for these tires compared to the OEM tires. Time will tell. However, if any of you are looking for tires, I would recommend these highly. For reference my car is an April 2018 LR-RWD Model 3 with FSD and 19\" rims.","len":410},{"id":"n1qnbq","subreddit":"Tesla","text":"Daily Discussion, Question and Answer, Experiences, and Support Thread: If you are new here (or even if you're not), please skim through our About and Rules pages to get more familiarity on potential updates or changes and what to expect. **Use this recurring thread for Q&A, sharing your ownership\/service experiences, general vehicle assistance, today's topics, sightings, customization, shop item discussions, etc.** **Links for answers to some of the most common questions!** * **Displayed\/Rated Range** **|** **Tesla Support** **|** **Winter Driving** **|** **Software Updates Megathreads** **Useful sites for vehicle management, software tracking, trip planning, and more** * Teslascope TeslaFi EV-FW Teslabout Optiwatt Useful Sites Wiki **Vehicle Manuals U.S.** * Model S Model 3 Model X Model Y * **NEW -** **Model 3 Video Manuals** **Resources:** * Gigathread Recent Highlights and Links * Popular Accessories * r\/AutoDetailing Cleaning\/detailing tips * Discord Live Chat * Subreddit Wiki * Tesla Vehicle History Comparisons * Print a Shareable Card made by u\/backstreetatnight u\/110110 **Please be kind**, genuine, and welcoming.

Comes with the territory of renting to strangers but it's all part of the adventure right? Tomorrow I will commence operation debug and will vigorously vacuum out the car and lay some sticky traps and distribute some poison bait but in the mean time I figured I would try to make things a little warm and toasty for my tiny nemesis's. In the past I have been able to heat my entire garage using the car. No problem generating copious amounts of heat to bring a 2 car garage into the high 80's in the dead of winter when it is near 0 outside. I tried doing the same thing today thinking that I could easily get the heat circulating in the car and get it into the 120+ range to hopefully evict or otherwise end my unwanted guests. To my surprise, I could not get the heat higher than 82 degrees. I verified that with a separate thermometer placed inside the car to verify the temp reported by the Tesla app. I tired a myriad of setting combinations from the app and inside the car. Using the defrost function in the app, setting the heat to HI both in the app and inside the car, setting everything to manual with the fan on 10, disabling AC and enabling recirculation in every possible combo. When interior temp sensor is reading below 82 I will get air out of the vents that is 120+, but once the temp reads 82 the output seems to cool back down to not let the car get hotter than this. Being a 2018 and not having the heat pump of the 2020 and 2021 models it shouldn't have a problem generating the heat needed. I did test with our Model Y and it too seemed to get stuck at 82 degrees.

TACC in its current form is pretty bad about weirdly lagging behind the situation. Ideally you maintain follow distance like you have a bar between you and the car in front of you (with slight allowance for not being jerky). You allow the distance to gradually increase if it appears that speed will remain high.

I hear a lot of dislike for the \"Autopilot\" name for Tesla's driver assistance software. People say that this encourages bad habits like trying to have the car drive while asleep or while they are not in the driver's seat. This seems way off-base to me. I will note most of my experience with the aeronautical side of this is on sims and from watching documentaries, but it is clear that even in planes, autopilot is not a set it and forget it system. If a commercial airliner is on autopilot and a problem occurs, the pilots are expected to be immediately ready to intervene. And I'm sure there are idiots with private planes that set the autopilot and go to sleep in the cabin with a timer to wake up before landing. But if a crash was to occur and the pilots' excuse was \"autopilot was running so we were taking a break\", they would be immediately blamed and either go to jail or at least never fly again. This is no different than what a Tesla expects on autopilot. It will take care of the controls most of the time, but you better be ready to take over when there is a situation that it can't handle. Now I make no excuse for Musk's claims of Level 5 \"just around the corner\"; there are way too many situations on autopilot and NOA that the system either can't handle or tries to take in a way that no human driver would find reasonable. But at the same time there is nothing in the car's documentation that would lead me to believe that this is the right way to drive the car.

I went with the Hansshow version over the Tesla Offer version because the Hansshow version is the same price AND has a box with crossovers and impedance balancing for the additional tweeters to be activated, which helps prevent overloading and damage to the whole system.

Prepare for many hours of uncomfortable\/awkward angles, cringe-inducing panels popping off\/back on, plastic pins falling into the floor\/void of the center console, etc... car mod beginners beware (I was one) If you have a post-2\/2020 build, your car won't have rear deck speakers (mine doesn't), so the wiring for that is relatively pointless unless you invest more money in those speakers.

A fart machine, a rainbow road effect on your dashboard, a Christmas dance, and the arcade. There are features and Easter eggs on Tesla's that no other car manufacturer would even fathom implementing. I think most of us would agree that a lot of the stuff Tesla adds are gimmicks. Most customers won't use a lot of them beyond showing it to a couple of friends when they check the car out. But within Tesla a team of engineers and designers and spent and awful lot of time and effort developing those feature, which begs the question who was it for? Also, how is Tesla like Nokia? What do you remember about the Nokia 3210? The fact it was one of the first phones with an internal antenna? It's fast T9 text entry? I just remember snake. I remember sitting in the back of my parents car, using their Nokia with my brother and us taking turns trying to beat the record on snake. My parents never played snake, even with us pestering them too. Those hours spent playing on that 3210 built up a subconscious, but fierce, loyalty to the Nokia brand. I loved their Windows phones, even with it's vast faults, and still today I will passionately defend the Windows phone platform and it's stylish tiles simply because I see the platform and Nokia as one. Every time I see a new Nokia model I cheer internally. If Tesla and Nokia are alike then maybe the MCU3 is the snake of it's day. A gaming console built into the car. You can play it in the back or front. Road trips just became gaming sessions. Those kids in the back seat will never look at another brand in the same way.

I know that plugging in the car is important to keep the battery warm, and it's important to me to keep the SoC at ~50% given that my daily trips amass to ~5% SoC spent and I've read that 50% is optimal for battery health. So if I have my car at ~50% SoC (my set limit), will keeping the car plugged in continue to keep the battery warm (even if it isn't charging due to the limit being met)? Does it continue to keep the battery warm by delivering energy via the charger whenever it senses heat loss or is it laying cold at its limit and doesn't charge until it's below the limit once again? My other question was about the charging rate: should I keep it at the lowest amp (5A) if I can afford to like my trips are short, and my main priority is battery longevity\/keeping the battery warm and the SoC at ~50%?

I am not wholly an expert on vehicle regulations (we have a whole cube row of lawyers dealing with that) but due to my job, I do know where to start looking. Don't take this as a final answer but take this as a place to start your own research. At an extremely high level, vehicle regulations fall into two buckets: US Regulations and the Rest of the World. Each country and region regulates vehicles in their own way but vehicle design typically falls into one or both of the above buckets. This is, in general, why you see vehicles built and sold in the rest of the world only for the US to be left out. This is also why the term \"homologation\" also come into play when trying to import it to another market. The two given buckets typically are the US Bucket consisting of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) decreed by NHTSA, EPA\/CARB handling emissions, DOT handling lighting, tires and a few other things, and a handful of other federal and local rules that typically cover bumper and light heights. The rest of the world typically follows the UN convention on vehicle standards (UNECE\/WP.29) with either no or few local modifications. Yes, CMVSS in Canada exists but it mostly follows FMVSS standards with a handful of exceptions, none of which apply here. With all that bullshit out of the way... FMVSS is silent on the steering wheel shapes (FMVSS 203 and 204 cover steering systems, mostly from an impact standpoint and where you get the collapsable columns you see now). Looking over to the UNECE, UN12 covers the Euro regs and again nothing is stated about wheel shapes. We're now left to local modifications of UNECE and US State Level Regulations. Someone in another post did find something in Pennsylvania regs but I haven't found the actual source on that. If that is true, you may see a 49 state\\* sellable vehicle without changes. Normally, you would see a 30-something state vehicle because emissions prevents it from being sold in states that follow CARB regs (see the 2020 Dodge Journey), but sometimes its other features on the vehicle that cause it to be considered illegal in that state. Long ago the orignal KJ Liberty had a Renegade trim with a light bar on the roof which made it illegal to sell in West Virginia with that light bar at the time due to the states limit on light height on roof bars (since updated).

My first attempt at a camera mount attached to the arm rest wasn't the greatest. In the video below, note the vehicles on the left and as I approach them the visualisation on the screen shows Autopilot focusing on it by changing to to a darker colour and then slowing down for it, as if the vehicle is in front of me. This happens fairly reliably on this stretch of motorway anytime I'm in the right lane and passing a vehicle: \u200b !video My main theory is that this is due to out of date navigation data, as this stretch of road up until \"recently\" (like a year or two ago) was a single laned road while the motorway was being completed. My assumption is that Autopilot is treating the left lane as an onramp and when it comes across vehicles in it, it assumes they're trying to merge into my lane and slows down to let them in. My region hasn't had a navigation update since around this time last year so this might make some sense. If this is the case, it's a little disappointing that out of date navigation data can cause Autopilot to be more of a hassle than help. I would assume that this will change as FSD progresses but at the moment it makes it a bit of a nuisance to other drivers on this part of the motorway as they have to slow down and speed up as Autopilot confuses itself especially the occasions when it decides that it needs to immediately get behind the car in the left lane by dramatically reducing the speed once it's side by side with the other car. It also could be that this is a current bug with Autopilot if others are seeing the same behaviour on well established motorways\/highways\/freeways.

Here is a diagram of my garage and driveway with some possible wall charger locations marked out. My goal is to install at least one Tesla wall charger and provide some flexibility for the future. Here's our usage: We have two vehicles. Let's call them Tesla and ICE. In the future, ICE may be replaced with another EV, either a second Tesla or another manufacturer. The garage is the primary parking spot for the Tesla. It will also occasionally be parked in the driveway, and I'd like to be able to charge from there if needed. The path between the house and the patio\/backyard gets a fair amount of traffic. Ideally, people would be able to use this path without stepping over a charging cable. We have a 100 Amp Subpanel in the garage with plenty of open circuits. I strongly prefer to drive straight into the garage, not back in. I will back in to the driveway spot if needed for occasional usage. So, I have marked out a few locations. Location \"A\" seems most convenient for charging the Tesla and also easily reaching the driveway with an 18' cord. Location \"B\" would allow me to reach the garage parking location and possibly keep the walkway more open if the cable runs along the back of the car. I could also reach the driveway if I back in. Location \"C\" is where I might want a second charger in the future. My thought is to install a wall charger in location A, and while I have an electrician out, running the necessary wires\/conduit to have a 14-50 outlet in location C for future-proofing or occasional charging with the mobile charger while in the driveway if I want the garage door closed. Ideally this 14-50 could be upgraded to a Tesla wall charger later if we end up with two Teslas. Does that make sense? Are we going to be tripping over the charge cable if it runs from position A to the left rear of the car when it's in the garage? With the fast charging from a wall charger, I can likely plug the car in at the end of the night and unplug on the way out in the morning, which minimizes the amount of time it's potentially in anyone's way.

I have had my M3 now since Oct 2018, and on most days I really enjoy it. I charge at home and this works out fine. But I have taken a few road trips, and generally speaking, the experience is poor. Factors that make a Tesla road trip a bad idea: 1. Cold weather 2. Hills 3. Speed, or time being a factor 4. Superchargers are fewer and further between, and have no amenities My trip to upstate NY checked all of these boxes. For starters, temps were in the 25-45 range, with winds. This automatically crushes your range. So you are starting out there. Second, if you want to make good time (i.e. drive 70-75 mph, this also has a large impact on your range). The result here was that I was only able to drive about 2 hours between charging stops. So you drive 2 hours, then stop for 20-30 mins to charge, repeat. This turned a 12 hour round trip into more like 16 hour trip. In upstate NY, the chargers are more spaced out, understandably. But this means it actually starts to become more nerve wracking to plan your trip. You can easily miscalculate and end up out of energy, in a very remote area. I shudder to think how long it may take a Tesla ranger to find you midway between say Binghamton and Rochester. So several times I looked at a route and saw that it was going to leave me with say 5-10% battery if I reached for the second charger, but in these cases with the weather, it was too mush risk. So we would have to stop earlier. Another thing is what is near your superchargers. In upstate NY, the choices are varied. Binghamton and Roscoe NY There is nothing around these except for diners, and not the good kind you'd want to eat at. Since you are stuck for at least 20 mins or more, sometimes you do anyway. I am trying to figure out how some of these places came to be. I mean, the one in Binghamton is next to some odd places, like Rochester NY This one was nice, next to a mall with plenty of coffee shops and such. In the future, I am likely to rent a car for any road trips, as the Tesla is just not designed for it. Perhaps if you are cruising at 55 with no need to arrive anywhere, in California in the warm sun, it's just fine. The car works great for me on normal days, commuting, going to the grocery store, bringing kids to practice. But if I am leaving the state, the charging takes forever.

I love the color blue, my Camaro was blue and man was it gorgeous, and Tesla's blue looks really nice in the pictures. However, I was at a gas station the other day and a brand new Model Y LR pulled in to get a drink or something, and I was floored at how good it looked. The owner had specced the pearl white color with the black turbine wheels and damn. It still had the temporary tag on it, so I know the black trim was factory as well. I'm sure a ton of people on here already know this, but if you haven't seen pearl white in person, go check it out, its not just plain white like you see on a lot of other cars. Its almost got this slight halo pearlescent effect that really makes the lines on the car pop.

We have one large garage on the first floor with assigned spots. I ended up hiring an electrical contractor to install a Tesla wall charger on the wall adjacent to my spot and run the conduit\/wire to our buildings electrical room adjacent to the garage. The power was pulled from the buildings common panel because there was ample room on the panel. The electrician installed a sub-meter and explained to me that I could have a separate ComEd account tied to this sub-meter. The install went though and everything from the charging perspective works great. However, the contractor now says that ComEd misled him and that they will not create a separate account tied to this sub-meter and I will have to just pay my pro-rated usage to the building each month. A problem with this plan is that the charger pulls \\~11 kW (240v, 48A) and my buildings business ComEd account charges a premium to pull this much power. Thus, I'm now paying more than my pro-rated energy consumption that is monitored by the sub-meter. Anyway I'm curious how other Tesla owners that have installed wall units in their condo buildings garage have done this work. Do you have a separate account? Tied to the building's account? or Tied to your units account?

Have some questions around reliability for that range of cars.: Hey y'all. As mentioned in the title, I'm looking at some older P85s in my part of the world, and I'm wanting to make sure I'm going in the right direction. I've (so far) driven a 90D Model X (fun, quiet and spacious) and a M3P (sweet baby Jesus). I'm aware that Tesla tends to update their vehicles over time, without really doing the whole generation\/mid-gen refresh cadence that other car companies deal with. So there's a bit that I'm going to be missing out on, like AWD, Autopilot\/FSD and battery chemical\/composition updates that I'm aware of. Part of the lure to vehicles from this timeframe is that they're rear-wheel drive (which I've heard handles better), as I don't really need AWD where I'm at. As far as pricing goes, it looks like a number of people are asking high 20s to low 30s for earlier Model S examples, with a mix of Performance and non-Performance. From my random internet searches\/visits, it sounds like that's a bit high to some Tesla enthusiasts. If there's a better price range there, let me know. With regards to reliability and build quality, I've read (and seen) that things can be a bit hit or miss. I still see a number of older Model S cars on the road (good) but I've heard that some of the more luxurious features (self-presenting door handles) cause trouble. I've seen a number of Bjorn Nyland's videos on YT (including some of the one where he gets the Millennium Falcon back) and it doesn't seem too far off from the kind of wear that you'd see with a gas car (radiator damage, ball joints, etc). Problem there is I'm aware of how much control Tesla wants to keep over their cars, and getting some parts sounds like it might be a bit tough. As far as what I'd like to use the car for... daily driving, road trips and occasional fun roads. Effectively a \"don't screw with it (much)\" kind of car.

The y-splitter connects both my dryer and my Tesla, but of course I will only use one at a time.

They also added a flash drive or something that held hundreds of audio files from exotic cars and their exhaust noises. I think they tied into the OBDII port and used the engine revs to control what exhaust note was played so it matched the exhaust sounds up. So you press the accelerator pedal and the corresponding sounds are played inside and out. The link I added kinds shows how it works with that sort of feature. I know Tesla could add a feature that would at least play to the interior of the car, but I think they could also use the BoomBox feature if they made allowed it to be used while in motion.

I have some questions, some are unique to the Cybertruck, while others are applicable to modern highly computerized and internet-connected machines and vehicles in general. (1) Cybertruck has an exoskeleton and bullet proof glass that can stop say a 9mm in short range from penetrating any of the body and glass panels. But what happens if you vehicle is crashed into a river\/lake? Normally you could break normal glass windows with something sharp, there are specialized glass window breaking tools for this. But they probably won't work on cybertruck's bulletproof windows, how would Tesla get around this? Same could happen if you crashed badly and somehow the vehicle caught fire and all of the doors and windows are jammed, etc. What is the escape plan for vehicle like Cyertruck? (2) As it is mostly agreed upon now that there is no such thing as an unhackable software\/device, almost anything will eventually reveal security vulnerability given time, especially for complex systems such as these connected self driving machines. This is not an issue for most people, but if you are a high value target such as a high profile politician or activist, there might be people specifically targeting you for assassination for example. On a regular old ICE vehicle, if for some reason the vehicle control is compromised, you can still kick the mechanical gear shifter into neutral and delivering no power to the wheels. On most vehicles, steering wheel and brakes are still mechanically connected only hydraulically or electrically boosted, so anyhow you can still apply steering and braking. But what would happen if my Tesla is compromised while in motion? They are such powerful vehicles that I doubt braking without assist would outpower a motor that have gone rogue? And if you say that the vehicle is designed to cut off power to the motor when braking is applied, I would counter that if it's design by software it should be considered hackable. Has Tesla given any sort of last-resort design consideration to a completely compromised scenario while vehicle is in motion? Is there some way for driver to physically disconnect battery power to all system, and relying on the mechanically connected steering and braking to still stop the vehicle in such an extreme scenario?

How true is that information? If I were to buy one I know from some research I'd need a dedicated charging outlet with a higher voltage ( don't remember exact numbers), but would I be able to fully recharge a Tesla over night to get all the places I need to go the next day?

I've seen the Tesla supercharger road map and they haven't made any tangible ingress into my area. Am I just not going to be able to get one until they expand? Have they looked into integrating rechargeable tech into their vehicles? I guess we haven't yet gotten our tech good enough to insert renewables that can effectively recharge.

At first, I was absolutely in love. I came from driving a 2009 Hyundai Sonata. I bought the car based on the aesthetics, it being electric, and the idea of it being a modern luxury car. To my fault, I didn't do much research and bought into the brand. My thought process: how different can it be? To this day, I thoroughly enjoy the instant acceleration (bought the $2k boost) and the precise handle. The car is very fun to drive. But the build quality issues and dealing with the service centers started to weigh on my sole. My trunk needed to be realigned after delivery, and the SC messed it up and gave me a loaner model x while they fixed their own poor job. During that period I told them my window trim (refreshed chrome delete) was shotty and they made me pay for a particular piece ($350 not the end of the world, even though car had 800 miles on it). My front dashboard speaker grill is crooked. My paint (black) has swirling and other imperfections throughout. I've grown to accept these things, as I would rather not deal with the service center. I am now beginning a new era of issues with this car. The interior cabin noise. I don't know how folks cannot see this as a problem. I live in LA, took a road trip to SF (had to supercharge twice for a 390 mile one way road trip going 75mph). Some of the roads were in terrible condition and that makes for unbearable noise in the cabin. Coupled with the wind noise, and the various rattles from all over, I am becoming an unhappy owner. And I'm coming from a car that was 11 years old, and the noise was never as bad as it is in this car. It is the furthest thing from luxury I can imagine, which I thought I was getting. Anyway, I want to love this car. I do. Based upon online reading, I see I can do some things that will make a difference. I understand that it is impossible to eliminate all road noise. I'm not looking for that. I'm looking for it to at least be as quiet as my sonata. I need recommendations, starting with tires, on how to mitigate the loud noises traveling at high speeds. I am willing to spend on aftermarket upgrades\/products. Anyone who has been in a similar situation that can point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. TL;DR 2021 Model 3 LR owner is looking to fall in love with his car again if he can fix the cabin noise issue, starting with tire recommendations (19\") Thanks everyone","len":475},{"id":"m56wca","subreddit":"Tesla","text":"Tesla Wall Connector shipping times: Hey guys, I just placed an order for a Model Y Long Range on Saturday, as well as a Tesla Wall Connector.

Tesla, please allow us more control over our wipers.: As many have stated here, a Snow Mode is a must in our cars for those living in cold weather areas. And if Tesla is looking to implement this, then please remove the last wiping from the windshield washing function during winter. Here's why: whenever you drive on busy winter highways after a snowfall and the roads are still wet from molten snow and ice, cars in front of you raise this dirty mist that causes your windshield to become brown, so you must continuously use the windshield washing function to keep it clean. On the Model 3 and Y, it throws washing fluid to the blades and perform three wipings. After the third wipe, the windshield is crystal clear, and it would remain like this at least for the next 3-5 minutes. But no... The car wants to make sure the windshield is as dry as possible, so a second after the third wipe, it performs this fourth and last one. During summer, that's ok and it does work as intended. But during winter, this last one screws everything and makes the windshield all dirty and messy again, especially when it's really cold outside.

Arrived at charger with 20m left and plugged in. Then got a strange message that it could not charge and that maybe the port was frozen. There was no debris or issues connecting but the port was making a clicking noise after plugging in the charger. Contacted Tesla roadside which is now chat based and she said please use the mobile app to set preconditioning to HI. I told her there is no such feature and she said ok set the climate to HI and then open the rear seat so heat could get into the trunk and warm up the port. (Yes, really).

I was wondering if the hardware embedded in 2017 poises a limitation compared to 2021. Would I be missing something in regards to FSD due to a hardware limitation on the 2017 model than what's currently offered? Is this specific model known for recalls in the past or some subtle faults found in manufacturing? Also I was wondering about the doors. I know which the Tesla Model 3, you have this card or your own phone that can open the doors for you, and with the Tesla Model S there's a key that my cousin showed me that looks like a mini car. Could you also use your phone with the Model S 75D to unlock the doors or is that not a thing? Lastly, I was wondering about charging. It's the 75D model, which I looked up and it can fuel roughly 260 miles per charge. I was wondering how quick it typically is to charge Tesla at charging stations and how much it costs depending on how much you charge it for. I live in San Francisco, and I occasionally visit family in Los Angeles. I know I would at least need to charge it once, but how long would I need to stay at a charging station before I can take off.

I've seen similar videos online where people also say \"Do not lease with Tesla!\" I thanked the salesman and was really appreciative of his advice. Checking with my bank and a 3rd-party lender, with a 710 FICO credit score, 5 year loan, and zero dollars down (just like the lease set up), everything I'm seeing puts the loan repayment at monthly charge of **$1,000**. That was way more than the $600 for leasing with the same zero money down. _URL_ I've read to not get a car loan that's more than 5 years as it's very risky, putting so much interest front loaded in the loan. On the hand, compacting that entire price into 5 years seems to be putting the monthly payment way beyond anything I can afford.

A little about me: I race cars and motorcycles at the track (expert level), so I have a good feel for cars and bikes. I've owned BMW M-cars for about 20-years before switching to Tesla. Now, everything other than electric (on the street) feels kind of clunky. Speaking only of daily drivers, not 'weekend\/track' type cars.

The car is beautiful to look at, I was drooling over it and was ready to order one. However, the driving experience left much to be desired. The steering was a bit sloppy compared to my Model 3. The accelerator wasn't as 'connected' to my right foot. It wasn't as smooth as I expected it to be. The car emulates having a transmission and literally puts in a small delay like a down-shift when you step on it. SUPER weird! Transition between no throttle and part throttle was choppy, like a non-electric. Regen was weak to non-existent. I couldn't figure out a way to disable creep mode. When reverse-parking, visibility out the back was bad and the backup camera was so warpy, it was practically useless. In a $100k+ car, that's inexcusable! The user interface was all touch with haptic feedback, but it failed to register clicks when trying to adjust the A\/C. Parts of the interior were plasticky.

It's a good car, but the fuel economy is significantly lower than the sticker. This seems to be on par with Fuelly estimates. I'm averaging around 18 mpg and I've been running 93 due to Cobb tuning saying the stock tune running 87 has an unsettling number of knock events which results in the ECU pulling timing. I was shopping between the Y and Outback XT and largely decided to go with the Subaru because of brand familiarity and spousal happiness. (Happy wife, happy life.) If the $7500 US federal tax credit returns or is reinstated because of a more climate friendly administration, that would be substantial since it would also combine with the NJ rebate of $5000, and I wouldn't pay sales tax. It would be hard to not trade in for the Y LR AWD for $50,990 including fees, but then reduced to $38,490. I actually spent more than that on the Outback by the time I added a few accessories and a 10\/100 manufacturer extended warranty (that was $1600 extra) which is financed for 0% for 63 months. I'm curious if I trade in the car to Tesla or Carvana, pay the difference out of pocket, and just keep paying the 0% 63 month loan as is now, since Tesla doesn't offer 0% financing. But this would only happen with the $7500 tax credit, otherwise I can't justify it financially. Maybe I will just return the warranty and just wait for the thing to blow up after 3\/36. And then there's the whole happy wife thing, but she is not enthused about expecting 25-30mpg and getting 2\/3rds of it. FWIW fuel costs annually would be over 15k: Outback XT @ 18 mpg = 833 gallons @ 2.50 = about 2100. At 3.00 = 2500. Electric runs about 17c\/kWh here, expecting around 3 miles kWh, 5 MW = $850. My best chance would probably be to appeal to her over a decade of ownership which would save around $20k.

Thoughts and Questions...: Has anyone here gone from a newer BMW M3\/M4, or something similar, to a Model 3? The recent refresh has me tempted and I really like the idea of having a lower maintenance car I can plug in at home, so I've been toying with the idea of selling my F80 M3 and finally making the switch to an EV. I've watched comparison videos and the Model 3 seems to come out favorably performance-wise, but I'm still concerned it might feel like a step down overall. Most of the owner reviews I've seen for the Model 3 are from people who are trading up. I've had my car for about five years now at \\~35k miles and I've had absolutely no problems with it so far. My favorite features are the HUD and the top-down parking camera, neither of which are offered by Tesla yet. It has other things I've taken for granted that I'd lose, like illuminated door handles and a built-in memory for loading and playing music (with working album art). Plus I prefer mechanical buttons over a touch screen and the BMW has buttons for everything, including a row of programmable buttons. I've also got the full leather dashboard and red seats so the interior feels premium as well. It's easily the most exciting car I've ever owned and I worry I'd regret selling it. I've looked over the supercharger maps and determined a Tesla could make it to most places I normally travel to. My dilemma is that having a BMW M3 makes me think I'd be disappointed with less than the M3P, while at the same time considering long-term battery wear on the M3P vs LR AWD gives me massive range anxiety. I don't know how I'd pick between them, and I don't have to choose between range and performance on my current car. From what I've read, the gap between actual range vs listed range is larger on the M3P. I'm also not a fan of the 20\" wheels. Would replacing those with lighter 18\" or 19\" wheels make the range more comparable to the LR AWD? Maybe I should wait a little longer for Tesla to improve the range and features on the M3? I can't help feeling like I'd be trading in a raw sophisticated driving machine for a peppy smartphone on wheels that makes fart noises (just my first impression from videos and no offense intended to owners, I know it's more than that). I plan to test drive one eventually to see for myself, but I'm really curious how others felt that made a similar trade.

I love you all. I've been a rabid supporter, defender, and investor in Tesla for over ten years. More of a lurker. It's come to the point I need my own car! I will get a cybertruck when it comes out and have both vehicles, but for now it's 3\/Y. I've dreamed of owning a Model 3 since before we knew the name of the car. Because of that I do have a pretty strong emotional connection with that specific vehicle. . . However I feel like with the long range battery the Model Y is just the better vehicle for the money. I don't necessarily need an LR specifically, but the price difference is negligible to me. I'll mainly use the vehicle within 50 miles and have home charging. I don't specifically need the extra Y space, but it will help once in a while I'm sure. So for me it comes down to 3 being better at SR level due to more range and less cost. However I believe the Y is better at the LR level due to less delta between price and range at that level. I do believe the SR 3 is the best car for the money available in the US. But I also would like to support the latest and greatest offering, the Y, which is top 3 as well. I'm a pretty cheap bastard so I'd prefer less cost, but I plan to keep the vehicle 20 years so big battery is better. I also need FSD as soon as it works as I have family who can't drive.

I feel like this would be a missed opportunity if the powers that be don't see that a well thought out and properly set-up V2G system could really alleviate many of the issues they're currently having. As more and more people switch to electric vehicles, and we confront well founded concerns about the grid's ability to handle such electricity demand, we should also be able to see that V2G could help with peaking generation as well as saving lives and the economy during an emergency. This subject should be pushed at the highest levels of government in order to facilitate OEMs and utility providers to make V2G a reality. As a Powerwall owner myself, I understand Powerwall owners that may initially regret their huge purchase if V2G becomes a reality soon, but on the contrary, I see it as an opportunity to increase my home's 27kWh system to well over 100kWh at minimal cost.

I'd love to see the poll results, because I do feel there could be some link between the OS you use and how technical your car is.

After achieving sales of more than 30,000 vehicles in March 2021, China's domestic new energy car companies began to buy various social media to discredit Tesla. The specific operation is to describe every Tesla car accident as: Unsafe, brake failure, automatic acceleration. The biggest trouble comes from the fact that these car companies funded a woman owner in a Tesla car accident, stood on the roof of the car at the largest auto show in China and loudly complained about the quality of Tesla cars. This has aroused national attention in China. Due to the increase in Tesla's sales, the Chinese official attitude has changed from welcoming Tesla to China to build factories last year to restricting Tesla. Tesla is prohibited from entering many areas, and Tesla is prohibited from many roads. Chinese officials began to cooperate with the propaganda methods of domestic car companies, and violently criticized Tesla in some national media. There are now three types of groups attacking Tesla in China: 1. Chinese officials, especially the order to restrict the group of Tesla vehicles and the group that attack Tesla without survey data 2. Chinese new energy car companies, Tesla is now growing too fast in China, affecting their interests 3. Patriots, Tesla is an American company. Although that man stepped down, China achieved a temporary victory.

Tesla lowered the weight of the new long range Model S by 6.5% (4,883 lbs to 4,561 lbs). They claim to have improved the battery chemistry. This combined and the car is only rated to achieve 10 more miles of range. The Tesla Model S Performance was rated at 348 miles. The Plaid has a range improvement of roughly 12% increase over this previous generation. Going from an 85kWh pack to a 100kWh pack is an increase of \\~17.5% in size, but there is a third motor which may or may not be less efficient, depending upon the \"tuning\" done. It makes sense to assume Tesla wants performance over efficiency for Plaid. And finally for the Plaid+, 522 miles is roughly a 33% increase over the 390 the Plaid Model S is rated to achieve. This was roughly the estimated range improvement increase expected as discussed during battery day. **The outcomes are:** * Plaid Model S should be a very high profit margin car, given it's 50% increase in pricing over the LR Model S, even when considering the extra motor and battery cells used. * The LR Model S is rated at 4.85 miles of range per kWh (beating the Lucid Air's top model which is rated at 4.58 miles\/kWh) and will be the most efficient electric vehicle on the market until the Plaid+ Model S is sold, which should achieve 5.22 miles of range per kWh. * The smaller battery pack for the LR Model S is what is allowing it to charger faster than the 3\/Y and the BMS\/cooling systems should also help (I'm guessing, the numbers will eventually be even better thanks to the cooling system). * Tesla will be less battery constrained, thanks to a reduction of 15% of battery cells for the LR versions of the Model S and X. * The Model S still does not charge at the same rate as the 3\/Y from a per energy used perspective. However, thanks to the new efficiency, it doesn't have to. **Extra Fun Speculation:** * The LR versions of Model S, X, 3 and Y are all going to have the same battery pack soon. All around 85kWh. However, the Model S\/X will retain other features (likely different motor design), which will enable the Model S to stay above the 3\/Y from a range perspective.

We are talking restarting, screen flickering off, visual glitches, no 3G or map downloading, and sometimes total unresponsiveness. In addition, one of the MCU went black and totally unresponsive for over a month, which caused a bunch of creature-comfort and feature losses. The biggest issue with this was that the blinkers were not working (not just the sounds, one of us stood outside the car to confirm that the blinkers weren't blinking). This makes the car TECHNICALLY road legal, because we could just drive around with our left arm out the window, gesturing for turns. Luckily, the eMMC chip warranty was extended just in November, to 8 years after original delivery. So we scheduled our service appointments, which were rescheduled by Tesla three times and finally landed two whole months after original complaint. During this time, we took diligent notes about every issue with time stamps. Lo and behold, the unresponsive MCU magically comes back online one night (this was not due to downloading firmware, which we had already gone through with a remote tech and didn't make a difference.) So we dropped off our cars and got a loaner. We texted the number with our issue logs, and two days later got a $0 invoice that said nothing was wrong. The service team couldn't replicate the issues (the issues are intermittent, hence the logs) they stated we did not provide logs (we absolutely did) and that we should just pick up the cars and complain if this happens again. These symptoms are 100% eMMC failure, from constant custumer complaints and NHTSA filings. How do we convince Tesla Service to fix the chip, outside of wait for a recall? We don't want to wait for this to happen again, as it could be months out and then take months to get serviced, and our 8 year eMMC warranties expire next year. Any advice?

Also, if you actually watch Netflix in the car it's a no-brainer and mind boggling it's not a feature. 5.1 music is still very niche, movies are certainly not.","len":119},{"id":"nnepss","subreddit":"Tesla","text":"Should I choose Tesla Insurance in California?: I'm picking up a model Y in a couple days in SF and need to pick insurance. I have quotes from Tesla Insurance and State Farm that are similarly priced. Are there advantages one way or the other? For example should I have greater confidence that things will get fixed correctly at Tesla's approved shops? Or is it too new of a program to really understand how well it works in practice.

So, my current understanding is, I need the following steps in order to theoretically charge a tesla via solar: * Solar panels wired up to solar charge controller * Solar charge controller wired up to Inverter (aiming for 3000W AC, but I think the minimum needed to charge is 1600W) * Inverter wired up to Tesla charging adapter","len":117},{"id":"mxgx1u","subreddit":"Tesla","text":"Daily Discussion, Question and Answer, Experiences, and Support Thread: If you are new here (or even if you're not), please skim through our Rules to get more familiarity on potential updates or changes and what to expect. **Use this recurring thread for Q&A, sharing your ownership\/service experiences, general vehicle assistance, today's topics, sightings, customization, shop item discussions, etc.** **Links for answers to some of the most common questions!** * **Displayed\/Rated Range** **|** **Tesla Support** **|** **Winter Driving** **|** **Software Updates Megathreads** **Useful sites for vehicle management, software tracking, trip planning, and more** * Teslascope TeslaFi EV-FW Teslabout Optiwatt Useful Sites Wiki **Vehicle Manuals U.S.** * Model S Model 3 Model X Model Y * **NEW -** **Model 3 Video Manuals** **Resources:** * Rules * Gigathread Recent Highlights and Links * Popular Accessories * r\/AutoDetailing Cleaning\/detailing tips * Discord Live Chat * Subreddit Wiki * Tesla Vehicle History Comparisons * Print a Shareable Card made by u\/backstreetatnight u\/110110 **Please be kind**, genuine, and welcoming.

This has not necessarily been a problem since I have used the mobile technician once before with a minor problem. Recently, however, I tried to schedule a new service to investigate an odd sound but it does not show an option for the mobile unit and only gives me the choice of a few different service centers at a minimum of 4 hours away. What causes the mobile unit to not be available? Is this just a temporary thing and is there any way to determine when it will be back.

I've been charging at home without any issues and haven't used a supercharger in over a year (not sure if this makes a difference) I called roadside assistance and they said that their end was showing my car with 225m left, which is still below the 253m it would be if charged to 100%. The app on my phone was also showing the correct battery charge.","len":118}]
