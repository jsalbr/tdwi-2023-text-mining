# PowerBI FullTextFilter-Plugin

This Plugin adds a Filter which can be used for applying fulltext-search-queries onto a single text column in your PowerBI report.
The filter offers an input field to type in the words to look for inside the chosen column. 
It supports the concatenation of multiple words with either 'AND' or 'OR', which can be chosen by the integrated radio buttons.
These words need to be separated by a *white space*.
Additionally the user can type in phrases made up of multiple words.
The visual will treat them as a whole, when surrounded by *double quotes*.
